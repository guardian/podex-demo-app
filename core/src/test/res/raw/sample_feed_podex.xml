      The official campaign post-mortem has been completed by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson, but with a whole lot of pictures of a dog? Katharine Murphy sits down with Weatherill to discuss the findings of the ‘warts-and-all’ review. Was Bill Shorten found untrustworthy by voters? Will the party continue to be overshadowed by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years? How will they combat disinformation in the future?

        <podx:caption>About the Puli:
          First, there are those dreadlocks, the instantly recognizable feature of the Puli (pronounced “Poo-lee”—”Pulik” is the plural). The coat’s naturally occurring cords are wooly, dense, and weatherproof. Either corded or brushed out, Puli coats require lots of attention. Under the dreads there’s a compact but powerful dog, standing 16 to 17 inches at the shoulder. Pulik are remarkably agile and light on their feet, earning a reputation as the “acrobat of the dog world.”</podx:caption>
